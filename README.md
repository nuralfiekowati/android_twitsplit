# android_twitsplit
How to split messages to post separately in social media.

Instead of rejecting a very long message (more than 50 characters), I make a new feature that will 
split the message into parts. In the scenario, they should be sent as multiple messages on the user's behalf, 
all of them meeting the 50 character requirement.

To get more update and for this project please look at Android Twitsplit Update project: https://github.com/nuralfiekowati/androidtwitsplit_update .
